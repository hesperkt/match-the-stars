# Match the Stars
Inspired by the phenomenal artwork and storytelling prowess of Trungles (https://www.trungles.com/), I developed a card matching game centering some of his tarot artwork.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Tinkering with the JavaScript to figure out how to make the cards turn and match with each other was an amazing challenge to work through! I absolutely adore how the deck turned out.

## Future Optimizations
- Utilize an image sprite for photos
- Possibly add rotating card options
